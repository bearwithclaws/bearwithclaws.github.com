<p class="meta">31 December 2012 - Penang, Malaysia</p>

It's been one hell of a ride.

The highlights:

- Pair programming with [Kamal](http://twitter.com/kamal) and [Kevin Francis](http://twitter.com/seraphine). Learned more in 2 months than an entire year of following books and tutorials.

- Startup Weekend Singapore. Came in 2nd place.

- Built and shipped [two](http://www.betabeat.com/2012/04/10/today-in-y-combinator-hacks-pairmixer-lets-you-thumbkiss-a-stranger/) [apps](http://pandodaily.com/2012/04/27/sink-or-ship-holds-your-wallet-hostage-to-ensure-your-projects-ship-on-time/) in a month with [Richerd](http://twitter.com/richerd). Scored tons of press and a YC interview (which we blew).

- Mentored in both Startup Weekend Cambodia and Founder Institute Singapore. Fulfilling.

- Spent 2 months in Canada. One of the most eye-opening experience in my life.

- Delivered my first [TEDx talk](http://www.danliew.com/2012/11/tedxyouthkl-2012-mountains-are-doable/#more-2348). 18 hours later, completed my first full marathon.

I will always remember year 2012 as the year of unexpected. Most of which that happened, happened on a whim or last minute decision. 

Bring on 2013.
