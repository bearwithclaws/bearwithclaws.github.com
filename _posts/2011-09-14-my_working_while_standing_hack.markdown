I like how [this article](http://ergo.human.cornell.edu/CUESitStand.html) addressed issues of "Sitting and Standing at Work" and the suggested solutions:

> Sit to do computer work. Sit using a height-adjustable, downward titling keyboard tray for the best work posture, then every 20 minutes stand for 2 minutes AND MOVE. The absolute time isn’t critical but about every 20-30 minutes take a posture break and move for a couple of minutes.  Simply standing is insufficient. Movement is important to get blood circulation through the muscles. Research shows that you don’t need to do vigorous exercise to get the benefits, just walking around is sufficient. So build in a pattern of creating greater movement variety in the workplace.

*Except* it's not so applicable in the real world. If your field of work depends on getting into flow (like coding/designing), the forced-interruption every 20-30 mins can be frustrating.

I've been working while standing for the past one and a half year. Here's how I did it instead:

- Instead of taking 2 minutes break every 20-30 minutes, I take 10-30 minutes break every 2-3 hours. This gives me reasonably amount of time to get into the flow and allows me to better relax myself and get ready for the next burst. *Note: Take real break and make sure you get away from the computer*.

- I sit/stand based on the type of work I'm doing. For example, I sit while I'm coding, and stand when doing design work. It also depends the mood. I could stand all day long on some day; while other day, I just want to sit all day. The key is to *listen to your body*.

- Standing posture is very important. Open your leg shoulder width apart, soft knees, spread your toes, back straight, neck neutral and arms in 90 degrees. Also, the first few weeks of using standing desk can be hard for your feet. I stood on a gym mat during that period of time. 

- Dance. *Seriously*. Nobody says you should stand still while working on a standing desk. Just open up [Earbits](http://earbits.com) or [MixCloud](http://mixcloud.com) (I recommend [DrumCode](http://www.drumcode.se/)), and start moving your feet while working. Who knows? **Dancing while working** might be the next big trend. Be sure to try it out and [let me know](mailto:lim@chengsoon.com) how that works out for you. &sect;
