This morning, I was in a room full of people. Hundreds of people, most of them were strangers to each other. 

But there was something different in the air.

These strangers, they were talking. They were talking to one another about where they came from, families, work, future plan...just about anything. They were engaged, laughing, and looked happy.

"How did that happen in first place?", I asked myself. Then I remembered that we weren't allow to have any sort of electronic devices in the room.

It was a sight to behold, in a nostalgic kind of way. I remembered when I was a kid, people used to talk to each other everywhere: at the morning market, bus station, post office, even at the hospital, wait, especially at the hospital.

In the room, I was talking to a 70+ year old grandmother. I learned that she has eight children, many grandchildren, illiterate, and could not speak English. 

And she will be in the US next month.

Not me.
