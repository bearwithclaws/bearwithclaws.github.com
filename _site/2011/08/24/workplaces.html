I've been working from home for the past couple of years. Home office mixes up my life with my work. I wake up. I work. I go back to sleep. There is also no sense of urgency. I feel like I have all the time in the world. It's a great place to learn and obtain new skills -- as learning takes time and patience, which the comfort of home provides.</p>

When I got bored at home, I work at Starbucks. Starbucks is lively, noisy and full of people. It's rejuvenating. It makes me feel connected to the rest of the world. And because of that, I often think of new ideas while working at Starbucks. <a href="http://hackermonthly.com">Hacker Monthly</a> is one of them.</p>

More than a month ago, I moved out from my home in Penang to join a co-working space -- <a href="http://fluentspace.my">Fluent Space</a> in the Klang valley. Fluent Space is spacious, well-designed and quiet. And I'm surrounded by all these awesome, like-minded people. I feel like I could take on any anything. At Fluent Space, I've been able to work on hard problems which I've been avoiding. Well, the unlimited supply of coffee certainly helps.</p>

<p><img src="/images/boothk.jpg" alt="BootHK" />
I've also visited <a href="http://boot.hk">BootHK</a>, a co-working space in Hong Kong few months ago. It certainly had a different atmosphere compare to Fluent Space. Everybody just sat around this big table, in a not-so-big room, with an intense look on their face, hustling. It felt like startups. I'd love to work there for a couple of month and see what happens. &sect;</p>
