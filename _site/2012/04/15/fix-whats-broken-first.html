<h1>Shipping Mantra: Fix What's Broken First</h1>
<p class="meta">15 April 2012 - Penang, Malaysia</p>


<p>So <a href="http://richerdchan.com">Richerd</a> and I were working on <a href="http://pairmixer.com">PairMixer</a> (matches singles on <a href="http://trypair.com">Pair</a>), our weekend project last week. We started by drafting the simplest flow of how things work and then spent the next few hours to churn out a prototype. The prototype was workable, but far from perfect. And then, we found ourselves having these conversations:</p>

<blockquote>"Should the user be able to share their profile?"<br />

"Can the user be on someone's waiting list if he/she is taken?"<br />
"Should we add gender preferences like other dating websites?"<br />
"Hmmmm...how do we supposed to get more female users?"<br />
(and many more)</blockquote>


<p>We spent a couple of hours debated among ourselves from these questions when:</p>

<ul>
<li>The app was buggy</li>
<li>The UI was horrendous.</li>
<li>We haven't tried deployment yet.</li>
</ul>


<p>Once we realized how little time we've gotten left, we finally had the conscience to say, "Let's just fix what's broken first".</p>

<p>As it turned out, we spent the remaining weekend fixing what's broken.</p>

<p>We <a href="http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=3822113">shipped in time</a>.</p>

<p>Fixing what's broken first. This sounded like a common sense piece of advice, but it surprises me how many people doesn't actually apply this. It certainly surprised me when I found myself not doing it. &sect;</p>
