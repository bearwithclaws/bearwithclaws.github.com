<h1>The Room</h1>
<p class="meta">20 April 2012 - Petaling Jaya, Malaysia</p>


<p>This morning, I was in a room full of people. Hundreds of people, most of them were strangers to each other.</p>

<p>But there was something different in the air.</p>

<p>These strangers, they were talking. They were talking to one another about where they came from, families, work, future plan...just about anything. They were engaged, laughing, and looked happy.</p>

<p>"How did that happen in first place?", I asked myself. Then I remembered that we weren't allow to have any sort of electronic devices in the room.</p>

<p>It was a sight to behold, in a nostalgic kind of way. I remembered when I was a kid, people used to talk to each other everywhere: at the morning market, bus station, post office, even at the hospital, wait, especially at the hospital.</p>

<p>In the room, I was talking to a 70+ year old grandmother. I learned that she has eight children, many grandchildren, illiterate, and could not speak English.</p>

<p>And she will be in the US next month.</p>

<p>Not me.</p>
