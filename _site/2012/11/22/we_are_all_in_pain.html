<h1>We are all in pain</h1>
<p class="meta">22 November 2012 - Penang, Malaysia</p>


<p>My ankles hurted. I didn't think I could run anymore. There was still 15km to go.</p>

<p>Ouch.</p>

<p>"Bad idea running a marathon after all these years of playing basketball," I thought to myself, trying to relate my pain to years of pounding my ankles on the court. "If it wasn't that, I would have been way ahead already." Thoughts like that made me felt good for a while.</p>

<p>Then I looked around. I saw a few runners stretching at the side of the road, probably due to leg cramps. Some runners were hobbling. Some were literally dragging their feet. Some runners ran really hard, and stopped, and ran hard again.</p>

<p>From the look of their face, <em>if there was one similarity among them, it's pain.</em></p>

<p>Suddenly, my pain wasn't so "special" anymore. We were all on equal ground. We were all on the same boat. This realization kept me going at my hardest until the end. I repeated these words at least a couple hundred times during the last few miles of the race:</p>

<p><strong>“We are all in pain. So keep going.”</strong></p>

<p>Keep going.</p>
